- - Now this is a story all about how
  - My life got flipped turned upside down
- - And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
  - I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
- - In West Philadelphia, born and raised
  - On the playground is where I spent most of my days
- - Chillin out, maxin, relaxin all cool
  - And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
- - When a couple of guys who were up to no good
  - Started makin trouble in my neighborhood
- - I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
  - And said You're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air
- - I whistled for a cab and when it came near
  - The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
- - If anything I could say that this cab was rare
  - But I thought Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to Bel-Air!
- - I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
  - And I yelled to the cabbie Yo holmes, smell ya later
- - Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
  - To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
